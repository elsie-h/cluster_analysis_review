These data are extracted from 44 studies in which cluster analysis was used to identify subtypes of asthma. The majority of these studies applied cluster analysis to mixed data (i.e. data with both categorical and continuous features). Selecting a data type below will generate a Sankey diagram of the studies with that data type, to illustrate the methods for rescaling, calculating proximities and clustering.
